All 4 programs are built by using 'make' and the executables are placed in the ./bin/ folder.¨

Each program is run as follows.

N2single NUM_BODIES ITERATIONS
N2parallel NUM_BODIES ITERATIONS NUM_THREADS
BH_single NUM_BODIES ITERATIONS THETA
BH_parallel NUM_BODIES ITERATIONS THETA NUM_THREADS

NUM_BODIES can optionally be replaced by the name of a file containing bodies created by the ./bin/generator program (also built by calling make).

generator FILENAME NUM_BODIES
